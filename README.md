# Imager
----

### Why re-invent the wheel?
This is a simple script to create a disk image from an existing, working SD card. It works on OSX, but would probably work on your particular linux distro.

### Usage
```
./bin/create-image.sh disk2
```
Where `disk2` is the location of the sd card found in `diskutil list`
